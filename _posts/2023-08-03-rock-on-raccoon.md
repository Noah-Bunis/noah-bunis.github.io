I worked on *Rock On, Raccoon!* during my summer internship at MassDigi studios. Taking on such a complex genre as a mobile rhythm game was an incredible challenge and I am incredibly proud of the result.

- Five playable music tracks, each with four difficulty levels
- A modular system for generating notes according to a beat map which could be constructed by non-programming team members or prospective modders of the game
- Support for multiple types of input devices
- Engaging visual feedback for hitting correct notes in addition to a score ranking system and online leaderboard


*Rock On, Raccoon!* is available on [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rock-on-raccoon/id6450372557) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MassDiGI.TeamCottonCandy)
