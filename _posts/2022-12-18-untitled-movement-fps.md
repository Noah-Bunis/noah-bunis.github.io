Untitled Movement FPS was my submission to the 7dfps game jam competition and my first experience working with Godot

Even with the limited time given I was able to create a deep movement system for the player to experiment with as they cleared the five levels as fast as they could.

In summary:
- Linear interpolation, particles and hitstop are incredibly fun in any game
- Players love it when you give them all the tools at the start and let them combine them in different ways
- I'll never use a dropdown menu for keybindings ever again
